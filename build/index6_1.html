						<h1 class="zd"> Ozen </h2>
						<p>Ozen is a very tall and rather slim woman speculated to stand at over 2 meters in height. She has a strangely shaped monochrome hairstyle that conceals the scalp deformations caused by the intensive exposure to The Curse of the Abyss.[4]
							Her eyes are pitch black and lusterless, giving her a rather unsettling and disturbing gaze. When fully equipped for delving, she wears bulky armor and a disc-shaped hat that covers her eyes.[5] Her White Whistle is adorned with a pair 
							of horns, giving it a bovine appearance. Despite being a White Whistle for over 50 years, she appears deceivingly youthful, with only her white hair showing her age.[2]
							Despite her youthful appearance, Ozen has been a White Whistle Delver for over 50 years. Some time in her life, she came to know a young Lyza. Initially unwelcoming of her, she attempted to drive the young girl off by threats of violence. It was only through Lyza's stubbornness and refusal to leave Ozen alone that Ozen was convinced of allowing the young girl to become her apprentice. The two became very close with each other and with time Lyza became a fellow White Whistle Delver. They were very fond of each other, as evidenced by Lyza once vowing to annihilate whoever attacked Ozen.[12]
							She was one of the members of the expedition to descend to the 4th Layer in search of the Special Grade Artifact, the Unheard Bell, along with Lyza and her husband Torka. Though she is deeply fond of Lyza, Ozen was disdainful of Lyza's marriage to Torka. As they journeyed down to the 4th Layer, the expedition suffered many casualties, including the death of Torka. By the time they had recovered the Unheard Bell, only Lyza and her remained.[13][14]
							While still in the depths of the 4th Layer, Ozen aided Lyza in the delivery of her baby. Tragically, the child was stillborn. On a whim, Ozen took the child's corpse and placed it inside the Curse-Warding Box.[15]
							While planning how to best resume the expedition, Ozen was startled by the child's cries. The miraculous resurrection of Lyza's baby prompted the two to abandon their mission and carry the Curse-Warding Box to the 2nd Layer, with the child in tow. Although not fond of the newborn, herself, Ozen assisted out of loyalty to her friend.[1][15]
							Two years later after Riko's birth and just before Lyza's "Last Dive" into the depths of the Abyss, Ozen had her last conversation with Lyza while looking at Orth from a balcony. She commented on the disturbing actions made by Riko when coming out of the Curse-Warding Box. The moment Riko was released, she tried crawling towards the center of the Abyss.
							Ozen then promises Lyza that, when the time came, she would reveal to Riko the true story of her birth. At some point in time, she became the guardian of the Seeker Camp, the commander of the delving team the Subterranean Bandits, and a mentor to Marulk after he was involved in an airship crash in the Abyss which took the lives of the crew.[16][17]
